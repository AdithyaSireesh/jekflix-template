# Learning the basics

Whether you're a high schooler, university student or even a self-learner, you would've come across Linear Algebra at some point in your life. It is the core of most areas of mathematics as it deals with concepts built on top of initution. Be it calculating the volumes of solids or optimization in machine learning algorithms, our little old bud Linear Algebra has got you covered.

## How did it all begin?

Accoring to the paper "HERMANN GRASSMANN AND THE CREATION OF LINEAR ALGEBRA", `Hermann Grassmann` could've been the first ever person to develop ideas around modern Linear Algebra. All his findings were documented in his book Ausdehnungslehre: The Theory of Extension. In his book, Grassmann talks about
  * the link between algebra and geometry
  * how linear algebra relates to the real world
  * Linear Spaces and Linear independence
  * Inner products & Linear Transformations

There have been many over the last few centuries who have taken these ideas further built new theories of Physics, chemistry, mathematics etc. Even though all these concepts are now considered the basics of Linear Algebra, they are hardly if not ever credited to the works of Grassmann. However, The Theory of Extension gives us a better idea of how this genius who did not even have a formal mathematical qualification came up with a theory which is now the cornerstone of modern mathematics.

## Okay, Grassmann is cool but, why are you telling me this?

Yes, I see why you might have this question in your mind right now.  Maths textbooks provide us a lot of useful information, and most of the times we even get some tit-bits of the history and origins of various mathematicians and math ideas. However, it is quite unfortunate that these are often overlooked. One reason could be that this information is normally pushed to the sides or bottom of the page (and the worst is when it is in the last few pages of the book), which I'm pretty sure 99% of the readers hardly ever look at. However, I have only recently tried to learn this way, and have found it a lot more effective. It is always useful to know about how something came about, thus giving us a better insight into what it took to develop that field/product/idea/concept etc., thus allowing us to appreciate the person's contributions infinitely more. It also gives us a benchmark to understand why things are done the way they are now-a-days.
Hope this has convinced you a bit.
